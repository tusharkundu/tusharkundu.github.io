<div class="paper-title">Costs or Benefits? Why Students Specialize in Cognitive vs Socio-Emotional Skills <span style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #666; font-style: italic;">[Draft Forthcoming]</span></div>
<p class="paper-abstract">I combine a field experiment in India with a structural model of multidimensional skill development to distinguish whether students primarily specialize in skills that are easier to learn (costs) or in those that provide more value (benefits). If specialization is cost-driven, teachers maximize welfare by reducing barriers to students' weakest skills; if benefit-driven, by developing their strengths. In practice, parents hold useful information about what skills benefit their child most, but large class sizes and informal communication limit teachers' access to these preferences. To address this, I survey 3,404 parents and 242 teachers across five private schools in India, and randomize whether teachers receive their classroom's parent survey data via a custom web portal. Parents report their child's skill levels and rank which skills they most want to improve. Parents vary widely in what skills they prioritize but on average prioritize improvement where their child is weakest. I elicit teachers' beliefs about parent priorities and find little alignment with actual parent views, even at the classroom level. Providing teachers this information increases their accuracy about classroom priorities by 10 percentage points. Treatment increases student specialization in parent-prioritized skills, with the largest effects where teacher beliefs were most inaccurate. Students in this setting specialize based on costs&#8212;developing skills that are easier to learn. By reducing informational barriers, structured parent feedback enables teachers to target instruction toward what their students value most.</p>

<div class="paper-authors">with Daniel Benjamin, Kristen Cooper, Ori Heffetz, and Miles Kimball</div>
<p class="paper-abstract">Philosophical perspectives on human desires and values vary; economic theory-driven measurement techniques can provide relevant empirical evidence. We elicited over half a million stated preference choices over 126 dimensions or "aspects" of well-being from a sample of 896 online respondents. We also elicited, via self-reported well-being (SWB) questions, respondents' current levels of the aspects. From the stated preference data, we estimate for each aspect its relative marginal utility per point on our 0-100 response scale. We validate these estimates by comparing them to alternative methods for estimating preferences, and we offer a range of estimates between those that take self-reports at face value and those that (over-)correct for potential social-desirability reporting bias. Our findings suggest that our respondents want, first and foremost, three basic things: family, money, and health (not necessarily in this order). While commonly studied concepts such as happiness, life satisfaction, where life ranks on a ladder, and meaning, are all important, respondents place the highest marginal utilities on aspects related to family well-being and health, and financial freedom and security. We document substantial heterogeneity in preferences across respondents within (but not between) demographic groups, with current SWB levels accounting for a significant portion of the variation.</p>

<div class="paper-authors">with Peter Bergman and Kadeem Noray</div>
<p class="paper-abstract">Increasingly, AI is being used as a gatekeeper to key areas that affect economic mobility. AI is screening applicants for jobs, loans, healthcare and housing. Generative AI has accelerated this trend; its pre-trained models can readily be deployed across a variety of contexts. However, there are concerns that these models discriminate against protected groups. We construct a model of applicant selection that distinguishes between different forms of discrimination -- taste-based discrimination, statistical discrimination, and biased beliefs -- at the employer or recruiter level. We collect data that allow us to record resume review and hiring outcomes for applicant profiles and overcome the selection issue of observing hiring outcomes only for interviewed applicants. We compare AI decision making to the distribution of human decision makers and use the model to simulate policies such as blinding resume characteristics ("ban the box") and to build non-discriminatory screening algorithms.</p>

<div class="paper-title">Closing the Last Mile: Norms and Expectations in Women's Job Uptake</div>
<div class="paper-authors">with Uditi Karna and Akanksha Vardani</div>
<p class="paper-abstract">We study the "last-mile" constraint to female labor force participation (FLFP) among graduates of the Calcutta Foundation's (CF) vocational programs in Kolkata, India. Low FLFP is a particular puzzle for India, as it remains low despite rising educational rates for women -- a stark contrast to other countries where rising female education has been accompanied by a commensurate increase in FLFP. Our focus is on a select sample of women who do not face well-documented barriers to work, as we survey CF graduates who have completed vocational training, report high willingness and family permission to work, and yet still remain out of the labor force. Our aim is to understand why, focusing on two possible levers: (i) second-order beliefs about community support for women's work, and (ii) expectations about the costs and benefits of work. We ask: can repeated, public community-engagement events increase job search and employment for women by (i) correcting women's beliefs about community support for women's work and/or (ii) correcting misaligned expectations about wages/ job conditions? We propose distinct activities during these events that help disentangle mechanisms, and reveal which lever is more dominant.</p>

<div class="paper-title">Preferences and Educational Choices of the Youth</div>
<div class="paper-authors">with Daniel Carvajal, Ellen Sahlström, Matti Sarvimäki, Mikko Silliman</div>
<div class="paper-status">(Pilot and Scoping Ongoing)</div>
<p class="paper-abstract">
We study how youths’ preferences over life outcomes—e.g., financial gains, social status, health—relate to educational choices and gaps across demographic groups. We elicit preferences via a hypothetical choice task adapted from a stated-preference framework (Benjamin <em>et al.</em>, 2025), link them to registry data, and analyze (i) how preferences vary by gender and migration background and map to actual choices, and (ii) how peer composition and network homophily shape preferences, validating patterns in culturally polarized classrooms (Anderberg <em>et al.</em>, 2025).

<div class="paper-authors">with Daniel Carvajal, Ellen Sahlström, Matti Sarvimäki, Mikko Silliman</div>
<div class="paper-status">(Pilot and Scoping Ongoing)</div>
  <p class="paper-abstract">
    We examine how students’ subjective well-being relates to grades. We construct a multidimensional well-being index combining self-reports with stated preferences over key life aspects (Benjamin <em>et al.</em>, 2017; Benjamin <em>et al.</em>, 2025). Using linked registry data, we (i) characterize well-being distributions and associations with achievement—especially for minority and disadvantaged students—and (ii) leverage unexpected family shocks (e.g., labor-market or health shocks) to quantify the well-being channel in academic outcomes.
