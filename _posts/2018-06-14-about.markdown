**Welcome!**

**I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at Columbia University, currently on the 2025–2026 job market.**

As an applied microeconomist, I study questions in **education, labor, development, and gender**, with much of my work using experimental and field-based methods.

Before Columbia, I completed my B.A. in Economics and Math at Swarthmore College (2017) and worked as a research assistant at USC and the NBER.  

Outside of research, I enjoy biking, climbing, and cooking the occasional biryani. My simple pleasures include James Acaster, instant coffee (sue me), sunny rooms, and saffron.
