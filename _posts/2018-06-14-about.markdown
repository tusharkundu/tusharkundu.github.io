Welcome! I am a 6th year PhD student in Economics at Columbia University. My primary research interests are in the fields of Education, Labor, Development, and Gender.

Before Columbia, I completed my Bachelors degree in economics and math at Swarthmore college in 2017, and worked as a research assistant at USC and the NBER. In my free time, I like to bike, climb, and cook the occasional biryani. My simple pleasures include James Acaster, instant coffee (sue me), sunny rooms, and saffron.
